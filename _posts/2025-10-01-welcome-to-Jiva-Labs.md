> ⚙️ **Jiva Labs** — where projects meet curiosity.

Hi, I'm **Jiva** 👋  
This space is my digital lab — a mix of cybersecurity projects, personal write-ups, research notes, and small experiments that I find interesting.

Here’s what you’ll find here:
- 🧠 **Technical write-ups** — from penetration testing to red team infrastructure.
- 🧩 **Projects** — hands-on builds, scripts, and tools I’m working on.
- 🧾 **Notes** — random thoughts, research findings, or quick references I want to keep around.

Everything here is open, simple, and practical.  
No fluff — just learning, building, and breaking things (responsibly).

Stay tuned for more updates 🚀  
Feel free to check out my posts and leave feedback!
